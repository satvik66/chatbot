# chatbot

This chatbot with a deep neural network lets people learn more about me.
Tensorflow and the tflearn library are used to develop the conversation bot.
NLP was used to process the user's inputs, and a neural network was used to decide which predefined response should be supplied to the user.

Installing each of the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file in your virtual environment (Anaconda) is the first step in running the program.
